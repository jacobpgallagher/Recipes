# Power Brownies
================
The goal is to make a Cliff Bar replacement


Isolated Soy Protein	1/4 cup
Whole Oats	1/2 cup
Rice Crispies	1/2 cup
Unprocessed Sugar	1/2 cup
Coconut, shredded	3 tablespoons
wheat germ	2 tablespoons
cocoa powder	2 tablespoons
Whole Wheat Flour	2 tablespoons
Ground Flax Seed	1 tablespoon
Water	11 tablespoons = 5.5 oz ~= 160 mL
oil	2 tablespoons
sow milk	3 tablespoons

Directions:
Preheat over to 250 degrees F.
Mix wet ingedients and flax seed together and let sit while mixing the rest.
Mix all other ingredients.
Mix in wet ingredients.
Place on some kind of gresed baking thing.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they look like they'll hold together.

Notes:
increase the coconut(can't taste it) or remove altogether.  Increase in soy protein believed to be acceptable.  Rice crispies provided negligible "crispiness."
